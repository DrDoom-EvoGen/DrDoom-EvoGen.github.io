      description:
        Aquatic plant evolutionary genomics. I am using whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing to identify quantitative trait loci and transcriptional differences in aquatic plants to predict herbicide resistance. This position is funded by a US Army Corps of Engineers grant that I co-wrote during my PhD.
