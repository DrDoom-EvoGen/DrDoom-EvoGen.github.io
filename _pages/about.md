I earned my MSc in Aquatic Science from Grand Valley State University’s Robert B. Annis Water Resources Institute, where I used molecular markers to determine the population structure and movement of an exploited fish species. My work there was ultimately used to redefine catch limits and management units of this fish species (see publications). I earned my PhD in Plant Genetics from the Plant Science and Plant Pathology Department at Montana State University in December 2021, where I developed my skills in genomics, working on invasive aquatic plants. Since then, I have been working as a post-doctoral researcher in Dr. Ryan A. Thum’s Lab at Montana State University, continuing to apply evolutionary genomics techniques for the better management of aquatic invasive plants. 

I have extensive experience in population genetics and genomics of various species. Generally, my work has focused on applying population genetics and evolutionary concepts to better manage species. I use genetic markers to determine population structuring and diversity and identify cryptic species. I use whole genome sequencing to determine genes of management interest. And, I use whole RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to determine gene expression differences that are important for management. I have also been involved in the sequencing and assembly of the *Myriophyllum spicatum* genome and have been using RNA-seq data to annotate genes in the genome.
